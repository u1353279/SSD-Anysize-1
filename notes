Trying to experiment with different layer attachments. 

Experiment 1: mobilenetv2 at standard outputs

CONFIG = {
    "training_path": "./training_temp",
    "backbone": "mobilenetv2",
    "backbone_model": None,  # Loads at runtime
    "input_dims": (300,300),
    "out_layers": [13, 18], # keep as None to revert to defaults. Right now ONLY 2 are supported. If not comfortable choosing layers just keep default
    "classes": None, # Populated during training
    "device": torch.device("cuda:0"), # cpu or cuda:0
    "batch_size": 8, # eval batch size is always 1 regardless of this setting
    "epochs": 10,
    "learning_rate": 0.0003,
    "weight_decay": 0.00005,  # l2 regularization
    "detection_threshold": 0.5,
    "save_results": True,
    "save_results_path": "./training_temp/out",
    "zip_dataset": "resized_license_plate_vehicle_1186.zip",
    "perform_train_val_split": False,
    "train_val_ratio": 0.9
